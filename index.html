                Many of the things discussed in this talk have got something to do with the internet. <br/>
                Either directly (smart devices, right?) or remotely (I personally learned pretty much everything I know about robots on the internet). <br />

                The sad fact is that according to UNESCO only 30% of the world population has access to the internet. What about those other 70%? <br />

                What foundation for learning equality is doing is giving people/mostly children access to educational videos and excercise from Khan Academy in parts of the world without internet connection. <br />

                I know you might be asking what does this have to do with robotics or smart devices but bear with me, I'll answer that question a bit later.

            There are many ways of answering this question. You could do it from the philosophical point of view, you could do it by looking at the technology or you could do it from the sociology standpoint (i.e. how machines change peoples lives and robots did, do and will do) but since I have no formal philosophy training, no real technology education and really have no clue about sociology I can't do it in any of these ways. <br />

            What I can offer do is to try to answer this question from perspective of someone who has been building robots for some time and learning awfuly lot in the process.

            But before we actually get to answer that question here are some things we need to discuss first.

            I try to follow one rule in classes which I teach. Actually, in most of them this is the only rule which then has other consequences but anyway, the rule is that no question should reamain unanswered.
